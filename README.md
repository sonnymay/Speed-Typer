Speed Typer
Speed Typer is a typing game designed to improve your typing speed and accuracy. The game presents you with a random passage to type, and your objective is to type it as quickly and accurately as possible. Your typing speed and accuracy are measured in words per minute (WPM) and accuracy percentage, respectively.

This project is developed by Sonny May using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can access the game on https://sonnymay.github.io/Speed-Typer/.

Game Rules

Type the passage as quickly and accurately as possible. The timer starts as soon as you start typing.
The game ends when you complete typing the passage, or when the time limit of 60 seconds is reached.
Your score is calculated based on your typing speed (WPM) and accuracy percentage.
